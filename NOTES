it might be worth building a whenever extension (whenever-rvm?) that allows something like:

set :rvm_ruby_version, "ruby-1.9.2-p180@gemset"
every "mon,wed,fri", :at => '5:02am, 3:02pm' do
  scriptcmd "delayed_job", :opts => "start", :rvm => rvm_ruby_version 
end
and then produces:

2 5,15 * * 1,3,5 /bin/bash -l -c 'if [ -x /your/path/script/delayed_job ] ; then source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm || echo && cd /your/path && rvm use --create ruby-1.9.2@gemset && RAILS_ENV=production /your/path/script/delayed_job start; fi'
needless to say, this is very verbose but does the job. i'm just rolling my own scriptcmd and will extend the rake command to do 'bundle exec rake' if requested.
